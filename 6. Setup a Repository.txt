Three methods : 
---------------------> 
1. From scratch 
2. From an existing project 
3. Cloning remote repository 

i. From scratch 
------------------> 
By executing the "git init" command in an empty folder which will become the root directory of our repository. 
This will create a blank repository which later we can add new artifacts to. 

ii. From an existing project 
--------------------------------> 
For an existing project folder with related files and directories we can issue the "git init" command to 
create the repository. Now the project artifacts will be brought under git version control. 

iii. Cloning remote repository 
-------------------------------------> 
Lastly, we can clone a remote repository from a remote server. For eg, from github to our local machine. 
Github, is arguably the most popular web based git repository hosting service in the world.
