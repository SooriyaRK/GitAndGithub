Version Control System (useful to developers) 

VCS - software that can store and maintain information about each and every change made to files and directories
(also called as artifacts) and these files and directories are brought under its control against a specific 
version number(this is called commit history). We can switch to a particular version in the commit history 
at any point of time. 

1. Very useful if we find that some recent changes in our project have introduced bugs (or) some other problems 
in our project. 
2. Also in the case of company with many developers, we can find version specific information about any file, 
such as who made the change, when the change was made and what code was changed easily using VCS. 
3. Comparing versions between different files sometimes prove extremely useful (particularly when debugging 
a issue even if the code was changed by other developers) 

Not just for developers. People in related role such as graphic web designer can benefit by storing different 
versions of image, layout etc., 

Generally, a person who wants to store multiple versions of a file will find version control system useful.
