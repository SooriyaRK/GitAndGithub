Every artifact (file/directory) of a project or repository under git version control generally has to go 
through three states or phases if we want to add it to a repository. 

1. Modified state - an artifact gets modified and saved in the file system under the operating system that 
the user is using. However the changes in the artifact have not been committed or saved to the git 
database yet. 

2. Staged state - a modified artifact is marked in its current version to go into the next commit snapshot. 
The term snapshot points to the state of an artifact at any point of time. 
"git add" command is used here 

3. Committed state - the artifact is stored in the local git database 
"git commit" command is used here 

So, the artifact moves from modified and then to staged and finally to the committed state as the artifact is 
ultimately saved in the git repository.
