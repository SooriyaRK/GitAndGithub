Github Authentication to connect to remote repo 
---------------------------------------------------> 
GitHub CLI
GitHub CLI will automatically store your Git credentials for you when you choose HTTPS as your 
preferred protocol for Git operations and answer "yes" to the prompt asking if you would like to 
authenticate to Git with your GitHub credentials.

Install GitHub CLI on macOS, Windows, or Linux.
In the command line, enter gh auth login, then follow the prompts.
When prompted for your preferred protocol for Git operations, select HTTPS.
When asked if you would like to authenticate to Git with your GitHub credentials, enter Y. (Also we need to set
path for system variables (environment variables) - git/bin path)


To push an existing repository from an command line 
----------------------------------------------------------> 
After creating remote repository in github, we will be getting an url. 

To push changes from local repository in our computer to remote repository on github 
In command line, go to repository folder  

$ git remote add origin repository-url     - sets up the connection to remote repository for our local 
repository 

origin - any name we want 

To upload the contents of the local repository to remote repository 
$ git push -u origin master     - to push the code from local to repo 

To pull the changes from github to local repository 
$ git pull
