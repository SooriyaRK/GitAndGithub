Git Branching - one of the most powerful feature of git 
Git branches are extremely lightweight (they have very little memory overhead or footprint and they dont take
a lot of disk space). They are fast and efficient to make use of 
Branches are simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commit we have made in our repository 

Whenever we create a repository in git, a branch called master is created for us. As a developer, we can also 
create new branches and update them anytime we like. 

Traditionally, the master branch is treated as production branch. This means the entire code base belonging to 
the master branch is kept production ready for deployment and no development activities are carried out here. 

Anytime we want to work on a new feature or release we can create a branch and then optionally merge some or 
all of our changes back at a later time to another branch. 
Also if developers wanted to fix bugs or test new features they create a new branch and make changes there, 
so as not to affect the main version of our application. Once the tested bug/feature have been added and 
fully tested, they can be merged back into the master branch. 

Bottom line : branches give flexibility to developers, allowing us to work on multiple versions of our 
project at once, or to maintain a released production version and test versions of our app. 

Commands in git bash shell 
-----------------------------> 
$ git branch - shows list of branches and active branch 
$ git branch develop - Creates new branch develop and this branch inherites all the files and commits from the 
branch from which it is created. 
$ git checkout develop - to switch to the develop branch 
$ git merge develop - Go to particular branch and to merge the changes from develop to that particular branch 
$ git branch -d develop - To delete the branch develop after merging it to the required branch
