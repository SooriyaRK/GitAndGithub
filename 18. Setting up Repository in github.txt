Create new repository by specifiying any name in github and once it is done, we will get some commands to 
connect and push the artifacts from the local repository to the created remote repository. We can copy the url 
of the repository to connect local repository to remote repository and push the artifacts into 
remote repository or to pull files from remote repository
