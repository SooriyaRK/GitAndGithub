Gitbash - command line terminal for git 

To check the present directory 
$ pwd (check whether it is in home directory ie. Users/Meenu) 

To see whether the configuration file has been initialized 
$ git config --global --list 

If no config file, shows error displaying 
fatal: unable to read config file 'C:/Users/meenu/.gitconfig': No such file or directory

If not configured, then we have to configure 
$ git config --global user.name "RSooriya" 

It will create entry in git config file if the file already exists, or create new one  
$ git config --global --list 
It will list the config file with username 

$ git config --global user.email "soormo291997@gmail.com" 
$git config --global --list 

List the config file with username and email 

$ vi ~/.gitconfig        - Opens up the gitconfig file and we can edit the file if needed  
To quit, type :q and enter 

$ cat ~/.gitconfig       - To list the file 

Various type of configuration file git uses : 
--------------------------------------------------> 
1. System 
2. Global 
3. Local 

System 
---------> 
Configuration value in this file are applied to all users on the machine and for all their repositories. The 
first place git looks for these values is in the /etc/.gitconfig file. This configuration file is rarely used
though. 

Global (already updated) 
-----------------------------> 
Configuration value in this file are applied to a single user and to all repositories belonging to that user. 
This file is located at ~/.gitconfig. This file can be used to overwrite configuration values set in System 
configuration file. 

Local 
----------> 
Values in this file apply to just a single repository. This file is located in a subfolder for a particular 
repository at .git folder in a file called config. This file can be used to overwrite configuration values 
set in the System or Global configuration file. If this file were committed to the repository, then the 
settings contained would impact all users that clone this repository. 

Each of these values (System, Global, Local) overwrites value in previous levels.
